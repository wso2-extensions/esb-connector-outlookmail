Product: WSO2 ESB Connector for Outlook Mail + Integration Tests

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
       https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-integration-base

Tested Platform:

 - Microsoft WINDOWS V-7
 - UBUNTU 14.04, Mac OSx 10.9
 - WSO2 ESB 4.9.0, 5.0.0-BETA

STEPS:

1. Download ESB 5.0.0-BETA from official website and extract the ESB and add "-XX:-UseSplitVerifier" under $JVM_MEM_OPTS into {ESB_HOME}/bin/wso2server.sh.

2.Follow the below mentioned steps for adding valid certificate to access outlook API over https.

     	i)   Extract the certificate from browser(Mozilla Firefox) by navigating to https://outlook.office.com/api
     	ii)  Go to new ESB 5.0.0-BETA folder and place the downloaded certificate in both "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" and "{OutlookMail_Connector_Home}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" folders.
     	iii) Navigate to "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import outlookMail certificate in to keystore.
     		 Give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

     		 NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from outlook. (e.g. *.outlook.com)
     			    CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. outlook)

     	iv)  Navigate to "{OutlookMail_Connector_Home}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import Shopify certificate in to keystore.
     		Give "wso2carbon" as password.

     		NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from outlook, change it accordingly. (e.g. *.outlook.com)
     			   CERT_NAME is an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. outlook)

3. The ESB should be configured as below;
   	Please make sure that the below mentioned Axis configurations are enabled (\repository\conf\axis2\axis2.xml).

    <messageFormatter contentType="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
                             class="org.apache.axis2.transport.http.XFormURLEncodedFormatter"/>
   	<messageBuilder contentType="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
                           class="org.apache.synapse.commons.builders.XFormURLEncodedBuilder"/>

   	Note: Add the above message formatter and the corresponding message builder only if they are not available in the axis configurations.
